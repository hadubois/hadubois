# Welcome to my world! 👾
Currently seeking internships after completing my 42 Common Core curriculum. Now doing some 42 advanced projects.

I enjoy pixel art. Also retro stuff like motos, moustaches, arcade games and more.🔧 To fix those some electronic knowledge helps. Thanks to 42 Paris I have learned that. 🥳
