# Welcome to my world!
Currently seeking internships after completing my 42 Common Core curriculum. Now doing some 42 advanced projects.

I enjoy pixel art. Also retro stuff like motos, moustaches, arcade games and more. To fix those some electronic knowledge helps. Thanks to 42 Paris I have learned that.

Check out my main projets in my [42 portfolio &rarr;](https://github.com/hadubois/42-portfolio)
